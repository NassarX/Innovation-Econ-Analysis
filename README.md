## Panel Data

### What Is Panel Data?

Panel data is a collection of quantities obtained across multiple individuals, that are assembled over even intervals in time and ordered chronologically. Examples of individual groups include individual people, countries, and companies.

### Panel Data Modeling

#### Panel Data and Heterogeneity

Panel data series modeling centers around addressing the likely dependence across data observations within the same group. In fact, the primary difference between panel data models and time series models, is that panel data models allow for heterogeneity across groups and introduce individual-specific effects.

As an example, we can consider a sample of our panel data series which includes data on innovation input sub-indices, innovation output sub-indices, and economic development variables of 10 different countries, including China, India, the United States, Japan, and Germany:

- A global pandemic, such as COVID-19, is likely to impact all 10 countries and cause changes in the innovation and economic development variables across all countries.
- A change in government policy on intellectual property rights, such as increased patent protection, may only affect certain countries, such as the United States and Japan, which have a high number of patents.
- A shift towards renewable energy sources may only impact certain countries, such as Germany and China, which have invested heavily in renewable energy innovation.
- An economic downturn in a specific region, such as Europe, may have a larger impact on certain countries within the region, such as Germany and France, which are major players in the European economy.

Panel data models include techniques that can address these heterogeneity across individuals. Furthermore, pure cross-sectional methods and pure time series models may not be valid in the presence of this heterogeneity.

As our dataset considered as a heterogeneous. We need to use a heterogeneous panel data models that allows for any or all of the model parameters to vary across individuals. In other words, we need to use a model that allows for individual-specific effects.

#### Individual-specific effects
Individual-specific effects capture unobserved heterogeneity across individuals that may be time-invariant, and therefore cannot be captured by time-varying regressors alone. They allow for individual-level variation in the intercept, or level, of the dependent variable, which can be especially important when studying economic or social phenomena.

For example, in a panel data set that tracks the earnings of individuals over time, individual-specific effects can capture unobserved factors such as differences in innate ability, personality traits, or social networks that affect an individual's earnings potential, but remain constant over time.

### Wide vs Long Panel Datasets?

Panel datasets can be organized in either long or wide format. 
- In long format, each variable is stacked into a single column, 
- In wide format, each variable has its own column. 

Long format is generally preferred in data analysis because it allows for easier data manipulation and more efficient data storage. Additionally, long format makes it easier to handle missing data and to perform statistical analyses. Therefore, we will use long format for our panel dataset in this project.
